            <h2>Fat Bikes</h2>
            <img src="img/fatbikes.jpg" alt="fat bikes" title="fat bikes" />
            <p>Fat bikes have really kicked off in the last 3 years and I am sure by now you have seen one of these beast rolling down a winter trail. But what is a fat bike? Well a fat bike is a bicycle with over-sized tires, typically 3.7" or larger that are designed for riding on soft unstable terrain such as snow and sand. These bikes are built around frames with large forks and stays to accommodate the wide rims required to fit these tires. At Shepherd bikes you will find a comprehensive selection of fat bikes and if you’re into back country touring then check out the Norco Bigfoot.<a href="bigfoot.html"> Bigfoot Bikes</a></p>
